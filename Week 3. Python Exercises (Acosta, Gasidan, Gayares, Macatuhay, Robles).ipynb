Armstrong Number (Narcissistic Number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ae47b48f","metadata":{"id":"ae47b48f","outputId":"94bea73d-673d-4ef2-af7f-a2306a1116fe"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","ARMSTRONG NUMBER\n","\n","Input number: 153\n","\n","The number  153  is an Armstrong number.\n","Do you want to continue ?
